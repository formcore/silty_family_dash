## PLANNED UPDATES:
* ~~Find some use for the remaining panel, currently showing an image.~~ I guess it's staying as an image, 
I'll update it to pull from a gallery uploaded via the website. * Set "stars" pane to show users 
individually, as opposed to totals shown currently. * ~~Add a check for existence of disk directory, if not 
found default to SD card on pi.~~ * ~~Move all "main" panels out of root and into a frame, allowing me to 
remove and replace with other "fullscreen" dialogues.~~
### Update HTML section to allow:
* ~~Adding new users~~ * ~~Changing usernames~~ * Admin panel to see other users additions * Update each page 
to allow applying to certain users (example, stars given to x instead of falling into a general nameless star 
pool) * ~~Change "rewards" to use locally hosted images~~ * Update each section to only show non-admin users 
content relative to themselves * ~~Add some functionality to add links to sidebar (currently only editable 
direct through Sqlite3)~~ * ~~Remove "icomoon" icons in favour of basic buttons~~ * ~~Move "change password" 
to some sort of controls page~~ * Figure out a way to set the "rules" to explain which users a particular 
rules applies to using a single column in the table, and only show rules that apply to the person viewing 
(unless admin) * Create seperate javascript / php code to handle each HTML page individually, allowing for 
greater customisation of each. * Recreate CSS for a newer, simpler layout, dropping mostly bloat formatting 
and cleaning the code up in general.
## Known bugs
* Adding stars on website may crash "Silty ui" fullscreen display, checks are in place but testing is 
required * Uptime sometimes shows "garbage" numbers at the end of the string, this is something to do with 
the admittedly awful method of just cutting up a long string of time * New posts on website use double 
newlines instead of just one. * Right now, I think it'd be too easy to SQL inject the site... if the website 
is public facing, back stuff up and be careful until it's fixed :(
